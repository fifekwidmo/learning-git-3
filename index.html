        <h2>My Favorite song</h2>
        <div class="main">
            <h3>Behind blue eyes</h3>
            <p>
                No one knows what it's like To be the bad man</br>
                To be the sad man</br>
                Behind blue eyes</br>
                And no one knows what it's like</br>
                To be hated</br>
                To be faded to telling only lies</br>
                </br>
                But my dreams they aren't as empty</br>
                As my conscience seems to be</br>
                I have hours, only lonely</br>
                My love is vengeance</br>
                That's never free</br>
                </br>
                No one knows what its like</br>
                To feel these feelings</br>
                Like I do</br>
                And I blame you</br>
                No one bites back as hard</br>
                On their anger</br>
                None of my pain and woe</br>
                Can show through</br>
                </br>
                But my dreams they aren't as empty</br>
                As my conscience seems to be</br>
                I have hours, only lonely</br>
                My love is vengeance</br>
                That's never free</br>
                </br>
                No one knows what its like</br>
                To be mistreated, to be defeated</br>
                Behind blue eyes</br>
                An no one know how to say</br>
                That they're sorry and don't worry</br>
                I'm not telling lies</br>
                </br>
                But my dreams they aren't as empty</br>
                As my conscience seems to be</br>
                I have hours, only lonely</br>
                My love is vengeance</br>
                That's never free</br>
                </br>
                No one knows what its like</br>
                To be the bad man</br>
                To be the sad man</br>
                Behind blue eyes</br>
            </p>
